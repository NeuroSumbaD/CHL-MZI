# Correlation graph:
- The 0.5-radius circle represents deltas in perpendicular diretions (i.e. no correlation).
- The 1-radius circle represents deltas in the same direction (i.e. perfect correlation).
- The 0-radius circle represents deltas in opposite directions (i.e. perfect negative correlation). Which is actually something given that having a negative mutual information still means that there is a correlation between the two variables.
