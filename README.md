# ViviLux

A package for simulating meshes of photonic elements with neuromorphic learning rules
*more info coming soon*

## Local Install

For testing and development, clone and cd into repository and type:

~~~ 
pip install -e .
~~~

## Simulator

A network must be defined in terms of the types of layer pools (number of neurons, activation functions, etc.), synaptic meshes (ideal abstractions verus hardware implmentations)

## Learning Rules

### CHL

## Optimizers

## Activations
